      <h1>Getting started with node.js</h1>
      <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
      <h3>Craig R Webster</h3>
      <h4>Senior Software Engineer, Agency.com</h4>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Hi, I'm Craig and I'm a senior software engineer at
        Agency.com. Mostly I look after the Rails projects there, but
        when Rails is your hammer everything looks like a thumb. Rails
        is nice but it isn't always the right tool for the job. It's
        good to have a decent idea of the technologies available
        outside the Rails and Ruby world.</p>
        <p>I've been using Javascript to support work that I do for the
        past 8 or so years but I started to get really interested in
        what Javascript could do about three years ago when I saw Rails
        spit out some mangled code to make a link POST some data...
        Basically thought "this is horrible, there has to be a better
        way". Through that I got into unobtrusive enhancement using
        Javascript and from there into reverse-http for more complex
        communication than would normally be available to a web browser.
        I'd seen a few applications use Javascript in environments
        outside the browser but hadn't really played with it.</p>
        <p>Recently I've been hearing whispers about node.js being the
        new hotness and figured I'd take a look. I had originally
        assumed it was something like reverse-http. Totally wrong.</p>
        <p>I've been using node.js for a few weeks now for toy projects
        and I'd like to show you how I got started and what I found
        out - a very brief introduction.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>What is node.js?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li class="incremental">Javascript framework for building scalable network programs</li>
        <li class="incremental">Efficient - evented, (mostly) non-blocking I/O</li>
        <li class="incremental">Simple - easy to learn, easy to use</li>
        <li class="incremental">Extensible - by wider community, uses <a href="http://commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a></li>
        <li class="incremental">Scalable - uses evented I/O</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>This talk is about node.js so a description of node.js would
        be handy. Unfortunately there's no one-line slogan on the
        nodejs.org site and the documentation is a little unclear about
        exactly what node.js is, prefering instead to talk about what
        it allows us to do, and giving examples of how to do that.
        After a little digging I found out that it's a Javascript
        framework geared towards building servers. I guess it's a little
        like Erlang/OTP's gen_server behavior... just without process
        supervision and hot code swapping.</p>
        <p>It's pretty simple to learn and use. The documentation is
        easily read and generally understandable in less than 30
        minutes.</p>
        <p>Node can be extended pretty easily too. By moving towards
        using the CommonJS specification for modules, node.js is
        allowing wider re-use of code developed for node.js
        applications elsewhere - and easing the process of bringing
        that code to be brought into node.js projects.</p>
        <p>One node process can easily handle many hundreds or
        thousands of connections because it uses evented I/O.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Evented I/O</h1>
      <p>Traditional I/O:</p>
      <pre><code>data = file.read("/foo/bar");
  // wait...
  doSomething(data);</pre></code>
      <p>Evented I/O:</p>
      <pre><code>file.read("/foo/bar", function(data) {
  // called after data is read
  doSomething(data);
});
otherThing(); // execute immediately;</code></pre>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>In case you haven't come across evented I/O before, here's
        difference between that and regular I/O.</p>
        <p>With traditional I/O when you read a file you have to
        wait for the data to be read before you can do anything else.
        You ask for the data, you wait for it to be read, you do
        something with the data.</p>
        <p>By using evented I/O you can register callbacks which are
        called when an event - such as data having been read - has
        completed. After registering a callback the program continues
        with no wait. When an event occurs node.js wakes up and
        executes the appropriate callback for that event. Callbacks
        are developer defined Javascript functions - nice and
        simple.</p>
        <p>It's not impossible to do this with most languages, but it
        can get pretty complex and CPU or memory intensive. Node.js
        uses epoll, kqueue, or /dev/poll) and non-blocking I/O calls
        like select so it doesn't need a bunch of native or green
        threads to avoid blocking. You don't have to worry about
        handling all that stuff.</p>
        <p>In node.js most of the I/O operations emit something called
        a promise which you then define your callbacks on.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Promises, promises</h1>
      <p>Naive rename and delete:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">posix.rename("/tmp/hello", "/tmp/world");
posix.unlink("/tmp/world");</code></pre>
      <p>Might fail - no guarantee which operation will complete
      first.</p>
      <p>Instead:</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">var promise = posix.rename("/tmp/hello", "/tmp/world");
promise.addCallback(function() {
  posix.unlink("/tmp/world");
};</code></pre>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Since most operations are no-blocking there's no guarantee
        which operation will complete first so the first example here
        may fail because the unlink completes first, before the rename
        operation completes.</p>
        <p>rename returns a promise though, and we can set the callback
        on that to unlink the file once the rename has completed -
        whenever that may be.</p>
        <p>In general a promise is an object that will do something
        when the operation it was created from has completed or failed
        - a promise to do something at some point later.</p>
        <p>Anyway, evented I/O isn't particularly big news if you've
        used EventMachine (or Twisted I believe), so what makes node.js
        worth looking at? Why shouldn't you just use Erlang/OTP,
        EventMachine, Twisted or whatever? Those tackle a similar set
        of problems, are well tested and generally well regarded in
        this area.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Why is it exciting?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Many people know Javascript</li>
        <li>Closures are familiar in Javascript</li>
        <li>Asynchronous programming fairly widespread</li>
        <li>Widely taught - courses are readily available</li>
        <li>Low enterprise impedance - already widely used and
        generally accepted</li>
        <li>Helps heal divided "front end" and "back end" teams</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Well, mainly it's about Javascript. The others are seen as a
        hard to get into because they're different to what most people
        are used to working with. For Javascript this isn't a problem
        since many people already use Javascript day-to-day.
        <p>When using Javascript you're used to the idea of closures
        (in Javascript: anonymous functions) being passed around.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Ajax most Javascript developers have at least a basic
        idea of what programming asynchronously is like, and unlike
        other languages Javascript isn't plagued by an abundance of
        libraries that rely on blocking calls.</p>
        <p>Javascript training courses are readily available.</p>
        <p>There's also very little to worry about in terms of company
        adoption since Javascript is most likely already used elsewhere
        in the company. It's a smaller step to adopt Javascript as a
        server-side language than it is to introduce something like Go
        or Erlang.</p>
        <p>Since it's Javascript we should hopefully have less of a
        divide between those who work on the client-side and those who
        work on the server-side. We're all talking the same language
        now, and while we'll continue to have specialities there's no
        reason that a client-side developer can't work side-by-side
        with a server-side developer.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>CommonJS Modules</h1>
      <p>A simple, standardised way of providing Javascript
      libraries.</p>
      <p>Define methods to make available to the world using
      <code>exports</code>.</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">exports.sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}</pre></code>
      <p>Import modules using <code>require</code>.</p>
      <pre><code class="javascript">var math = require("./math");
math.sum(1, 2); // => 3</code></pre>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>In a previous slide I mentionded that node.js is easily
        extensible because it makes use of CommonJS. So what's
        that?</p>
        <p>CommonJS is an attempt to expand the standard library
        provided by the Javascript specification into something that is
        useful beyond the browser-based world that Javascript is
        normally confined to. It's been around for about a year and V8
        is just one of many places that it's being implemented.</p>
        <p>This code example shows how CommonJS can be used. require is
        a construct used to import Javascript modules. It takes as an
        argument the module name that you wish to load.
        <code class="javascript">sys</code> is a built-in node.js
        module for printing to standard out ("puts"), printing
        debugging information (which it does synchronously unlike most
        other I/O operations), inspection of objects, and external
        command execution.</p>
        <p>There are other built-in modules for handling things like
        file I/O (the POSIX module), HTTP servers (there's a server and
        a client implementation in the HTTP module), generic TCP
        servers (the TCP module), DNS lookups (the DNS module) and
        several others. It's also possible to write your own according
        to the CommonJS specification.</p>
        <p>To write your own you define properties on the exports object
        which are then returned from a <code>require()</code> on that
        file. This slide is a very simple example of how that would
        work. There are plenty of libraries out there already, and
        node.js comes with a few built-in.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Canonical first program is pretty easy to implement.</p>
      <p><pre><code class="javascript">var sys = require('sys');
sys.puts('Hello, World!');</code></pre><p>
      <p>Running it is simple too.</p>
      <p><pre><code class="bash">node hello-world.js</code></pre></p>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Now we've got an idea of how CommonJS works, let's take a
        look at a node.js program. This is a typical first program
        which simply prints "Hello, World!" on the screen.</p>
        <p>Node.js programs are run pretty much the same as shell
        scripts.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Hello, Interwebs!</h1>
      <p>Node.js helps us build servers. Here's a simple HTTP server.</p>
      <p><pre><code class="javascript">var sys  = require("sys"),
    http = require("http");
http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  var headers = { "Content-Type": "text/plain" };
  response.sendHeader(200, headers);
  response.sendBody("Hello, World!\n");
  response.finish();
}).listen(8000);
sys.puts("&gt; Running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/");</code></pre><p>
    <p><pre><code class="bash">node hello-interwebs.js
&gt; Running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code></pre></p>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Printing to the screen is a bit boring. Node.js is meant to
        help us build networked programs. Here's how node.js can be
        used to produce a simple web server. Run the code and you'll
        get a server listening on port 8000 that'll say "Hello, World!"
        to anyone that connects. Simple, huh?</p>
        <p>Already it can handle silly amounts of connections - I
        exceeded the number of available outgoing ports when testing it
        and it didn't break a sweat.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Hello, Internets!</h1>
      <p>Here's a simple TCP server (the echo service).</p>
      <p><pre><code class="javascript">var tcp  = require("tcp");
tcp.createServer(function(socket) {
  socket.addListener('receive', function(data) {
    socket.send(data);
  })
}).listen(8001);</code></pre><p>
      <p><pre><code class="bash">node hello-interwebs.js</code></pre></p>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Networked programs are a little more than just HTTP servers
        though. There's service called echo that is meant to just
        repeat back whatever data you send it. Here's how to implement
        it in node.js.</p>
        <p>We've seen HTTP and TCP servers built easily using built-in
        modules. These modules can also create clients, and other
        built-in modules include POSIX (for working with files),
        Multipart for parsing submitted form-data, DNS for working with
        names and IP addresses, Assert for writing tests, path for
        working with filesystem paths, URL for parsing URIs and Query
        String for doing the same with query-strings. I won't
        demonstrate all of those, but you can see that there's plenty
        of helpful things there for building your own services and it's
        easy to add more.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Installing</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Takes ~2 minutes</li>
        <li><code>git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git</code></li>
        <li><code>cd node</code></li>
        <li><code>./configure</code></li>
        <li><code>make</code></li>
        <li><code>make test</code> (optional)</li>
        <li><code>make install</code></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Well, that's the brief run-down. Hopefully you're thinking
        that it seems pretty simple to get started building network
        services with node. If so, installing node.js takes just a
        couple of minutes. Clone the repository, do the traditional
        compilation dance and you're good to go. All dependencies are
        included in the repository. Please do let me know how you get
        on.</p>
