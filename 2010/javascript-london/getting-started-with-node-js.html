      <h4>Senior Software Engineer, Agency.com</h4>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Hi, I'm Craig and I'm a senior software engineer at
        Agency.com. Mostly I look after the Rails projects there, but
        when Rails is your hammer everything looks like a thumb. It's
        good to have a decent idea of the technologies available
        outside the Rails and Ruby world.</p>
        <p>I've been using Javascript to support work that I do for the
        past 8 or so years but I started to get raelly interested in
        what Javascript could do about three years ago when I saw Rails
        spit out some mangled code to make a link POST some data...
        Basically thought "this is horrible, there has to be a better
        way". Through that I got into unobtrusive enhancement using
        Javascript and from there into reverse-http for more complex
        communication than would normally be available to a web browser.
        I'd seen a few applications use Javascript in environments
        outside the browser but hadn't really played with it.</p>
        <p>Recently I've been hearing whispers about node.js being the
        new hotness and figured I'd take a look. I had originally
        assumed it was something like reverse-http. Totally wrong.</p>
        <p>I've been using node.js for a few weeks now for toy projects
        and I'd like to show you how I got started and what I found
        out.</p>

      <h1>This talk</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>A brief introduction to node.js</li>
        <li>Building an application</li>
        <li>Ways of interacting with clients</li>
        <li>Crazy ideas</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>In this talk I'll go over what node.js actually is, why I'm
        interested in it, how to install it and get a simple
        application running, the sort of client interactions that it
        enables us to use and some crazy ideas that I think could be
        adopted to fit into a node.js world.</p>

      <h1>What is node.js?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li class="incremental">Javascript framework for building servers</li>
        <li class="incremental">Efficient - evented, non-blocking I/O</li>
        <li class="incremental">Simple - designed to avoid complexity traditionally encountered here</li>
        <li class="incremental">Fast - built on Google's V8 Javascript engine</li>
        <li class="incremental">Extensible - by wider community, uses <a href="http://commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>This talk is about node.js so a description of node.js would
        be handy. Unfortunately there's no one-line slogan on the
        nodejs.org site and the documentation is a little unclear about
        exactly what node.js is, prefering instead to talk about what
        it allows us to do, and giving examples of how to do that.
        After a little digging I found out that it's a Javascript
        framework geared towards building servers. I guess it's a little
        like Erlang/OTP's gen_server behavior... just without process
        supervision and hot code swapping.</p>
        <p>It uses an event-driven architecture (epoll, kqueue, or
        /dev/poll) and non-blocking I/O (select) so it doesn't need a
        bunch of native or green threads to avoid blocking. Pretty
        handy on memory and CPU that.</p>
        <p>When an event occurs node.js wakes up and executes the
        appropriate callback for that event. Callbacks are developer
        defined Javascript functions - nice and simple.</p>
        <p>Node.js runs on Google's V8 Javascript engine which uses a
        bunch of funky techniques to make your Javascript run
        <em>fast</em>. V8 is included in the node.js distribution so you
        don't need to worry about installing it separately.</p>
        <p>By moving towards using the CommonJS specification for
        modules node.js is allowing wider re-use of code developed for
        node.js applications elsewhere - and easing the process of
        bringing that code to be brought into node.js projects.</p>

      <h1>Why is it exciting?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Many people know Javascript</li>
        <li>Similar to other languages - can cross-train</li>
        <li>Widely taught - courses are readily available</li>
        <li>Low enterprise impedance - already widely used and generally accepted</li>
        <li>Unifies "front end" and "back end" teams</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>What makes node.js exciting? Why shouldn't I just use
        Erlang? That tackles a similar set of problems and is well
        tested and highly regarded in this area.</p>
        <p>Well, mainly it's about Javascript. Erlang is seen as a hard
        language to get into because it's different to what most people
        are used to working with. For Javascript this isn't a problem
        since many people already use Javascript day-to-day.</p>
        <p>Where people don't already use Javascript but do use some
        other language it's pretty easy to cross-train because it looks
        and feels similar to Ruby, PHP or Perl - or at least it's not
        different enough to cause serious issues.</p>
        <p>Even if you need to start from scratch, Javascript training
        courses are readily available.</p>
        <p>There's also very little to worry about in terms of company
        adoption since Javascript is most likely already used elsewhere
        in the company. It's a smaller step to adopt Javascript as a
        server-side language than it is to introduce something like Go
        or Erlang.</p>
        <p>Since it's Javascript we should hopefully have less of a
        divide between those who work on the client-side and those who
        work on the server-side. We're all talking the same language
        now, and while we'll continue to have specialities there's no
        reason that a client-side developer can't change the behaviour
        of the server. This could be seen as a gateway for learning
        more about the other side of the divide for either team.</p>

        <p>Installing node.js takes just a couple of minutes. Clone the
        repository and do the traditional compilation dance.</p>
