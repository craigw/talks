      <h3>Craig R Webster</h3>
      <h4>Senior Software Engineer, Agency.com</h4>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Hi, I'm Craig and I'm a senior software engineer at
        Agency.com. Mostly I look after the Rails projects there, but
        when Rails is your hammer everything looks like a thumb. It's
        good to have a decent idea of the technologies available
        outside the Rails and Ruby world.</p>
        <p>I've been using Javascript to support work that I do for the
        past 8 or so years but I started to get raelly interested in
        what Javascript could do about three years ago when I saw Rails
        spit out some mangled code to make a link POST some data...
        Basically thought "this is horrible, there has to be a better
        way". Through that I got into unobtrusive enhancement using
        Javascript and from there into reverse-http for more complex
        communication than would normally be available to a web browser.
        I'd seen a few applications use Javascript in environments
        outside the browser but hadn't really played with it.</p>
        <p>Recently I've been hearing whispers about node.js being the
        new hotness and figured I'd take a look. I had originally
        assumed it was something like reverse-http. Totally wrong.</p>
        <p>I've been using node.js for a few weeks now for toy projects
        and I'd like to show you how I got started and what I found
        out.</p>

      <h1>This talk</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>A brief introduction to node.js</li>
        <li>Building an application</li>
        <li>Ways of interacting with clients</li>
        <li>Crazy ideas</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>In this talk I'll go over what node.js actually is, why I'm
        interested in it, how to install it and get a simple
        application running, the sort of client interactions that it
        enables us to use and some crazy ideas that I think could be
        adopted to fit into a node.js world.</p>

      <h1>What is node.js?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li class="incremental">Javascript framework for building servers</li>
        <li class="incremental">Efficient - evented, non-blocking I/O</li>
        <li class="incremental">Simple - designed to avoid complexity traditionally encountered here</li>
        <li class="incremental">Fast - built on Google's V8 Javascript engine</li>
        <li class="incremental">Extensible - by wider community, uses <a href="http://commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>This talk is about node.js so a description of node.js would
        be handy. Unfortunately there's no one-line slogan on the
        nodejs.org site and the documentation is a little unclear about
        exactly what node.js is, prefering instead to talk about what
        it allows us to do, and giving examples of how to do that.
        After a little digging I found out that it's a Javascript
        framework geared towards building servers. I guess it's a little
        like Erlang/OTP's gen_server behavior... just without process
        supervision and hot code swapping.</p>
        <p>It uses an event-driven architecture (epoll, kqueue, or
        /dev/poll) and non-blocking I/O (select) so it doesn't need a
        bunch of native or green threads to avoid blocking. Pretty
        handy on memory and CPU that.</p>
        <p>When an event occurs node.js wakes up and executes the
        appropriate callback for that event. Callbacks are developer
        defined Javascript functions - nice and simple.</p>
        <p>Node.js runs on Google's V8 Javascript engine which uses a
        bunch of funky techniques to make your Javascript run
        <em>fast</em>. V8 is included in the node.js distribution so you
        don't need to worry about installing it separately.</p>
        <p>By moving towards using the CommonJS specification for
        modules node.js is allowing wider re-use of code developed for
        node.js applications elsewhere - and easing the process of
        bringing that code to be brought into node.js projects.</p>

      <h1>Why is it exciting?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Many people know Javascript</li>
        <li>Similar to other languages - can cross-train</li>
        <li>Widely taught - courses are readily available</li>
        <li>Low enterprise impedance - already widely used and
        generally accepted</li>
        <li>Unifies "front end" and "back end" teams</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>What makes node.js exciting? Why shouldn't I just use
        Erlang? That tackles a similar set of problems and is well
        tested and highly regarded in this area.</p>
        <p>Well, mainly it's about Javascript. Erlang is seen as a hard
        language to get into because it's different to what most people
        are used to working with. For Javascript this isn't a problem
        since many people already use Javascript day-to-day.</p>
        <p>Where people don't already use Javascript but do use some
        other language it's pretty easy to cross-train because it looks
        and feels similar to Ruby, PHP or Perl - or at least it's not
        different enough to cause serious issues.</p>
        <p>Even if you need to start from scratch, Javascript training
        courses are readily available.</p>
        <p>There's also very little to worry about in terms of company
        adoption since Javascript is most likely already used elsewhere
        in the company. It's a smaller step to adopt Javascript as a
        server-side language than it is to introduce something like Go
        or Erlang.</p>
        <p>Since it's Javascript we should hopefully have less of a
        divide between those who work on the client-side and those who
        work on the server-side. We're all talking the same language
        now, and while we'll continue to have specialities there's no
        reason that a client-side developer can't change the behaviour
        of the server. This could be seen as a gateway for learning
        more about the other side of the divide for either team.</p>

      <h1>Installing</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Takes ~2 minutes</li>
        <li><code>git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git</code></li>
        <li><code>cd node</code></li>
        <li><code>./configure</code></li>
        <li><code>make</code></li>
        <li><code>make test</code> (optional)</li>
        <li><code>make install</code></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>Installing node.js takes just a couple of minutes. Clone the
        repository and do the traditional compilation dance.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Canonical first program is pretty easy to implement.</p>
      <p><pre><code class="javascript">var sys = require('sys');
sys.puts('Hello, World!');</code></pre><p>
      <p>Running it is simple too.</p>
      <p><pre><code class="bash">node hello-world.js</code></pre></p>
      <div class="handout">
        <p>require is a <a href="http://commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a>
        construct to import Javascript modules. CommonJS is an attempt
        to expand the standard library provided by the Javascript
        specification into something that is useful beyond the
        browser-based world that Javascript is normally confined to.
        It's been around for bout a year and V8 is just one of many
        places that it's being implemented.</p>
        <p><code class="javascript">sys</code> is a built-in node.js
        module for printing to standard out ("puts"), printing
        debugging information (which it does synchronously unlike most
        other I/O operations), inspection of objects, and external
        command execution.</p>
        <p>There are other built-in modules for handling things like
        file I/O (the POSIX module), HTTP servers (there's a server and
        a client implementation in the HTTP module), generic TCP
        servers (the TCP module), DNS lookups (the DNS module) and
        several others. It's also possible to write your own according
        to the CommonJS specification.</p>

      <h1>Hello, Interwebs!</h1>
      <p>Of course, node.js aims to help us build servers. So let's do
      that.</p>

    http = require("http");
http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  var headers = { "Content-Type": "text/plain" };

  response.sendBody("Hello World\n");
  response.finish();
}).listen(8000);
